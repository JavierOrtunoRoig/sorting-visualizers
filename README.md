# Sorting Visualizer

In this project, I have created a sorting visualizer using **Svelte**. It is important to understand how sorting algorithms work and how they are implemented. It is also important for a developer to know how to visualize the sorting algorithms. This project is a part of my journey to learn **Svelte**.

## Sorting Algorithms

At this moment, the following sorting algorithms are implemented:
 - bubble sort

In the future, I will add more sorting algorithms.
